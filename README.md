# Weather-Dashboard

## Description
The purpose of this project was to allow a user to get the current weather as well as the weather for the next few
days for a given city. I built this to gain experience working with api calls.

After you hit search your results will appear and a history of your searches will automatically populate below the search
bar. If you want to search for a city again, you can just click the city in the history.
